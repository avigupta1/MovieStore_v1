README for MovieStore App

A simple and user-friendly Web Application, MovieStore allows you to keep track of all the good things you're yet to see. 
With a Search feature that uses RapidApi's IMDb API, you get access to information on all the World's Top Movies and Series.

Just look up the name of your Movie or Series, and add it to your WatchCart. 
You can attach comments to Saved Items, and when you're done, leave a review for yourself. 
You can also remove stuff from your Cart - but I think you should save the Good things you're recommended.


If you're cloning this repository, be sure to set up MongoDB properly. I have also added the node_modules directory.
